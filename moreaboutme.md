## I'm relatively nice.
Unless you're homophobic, racist, transphobic, etc. then, I'm just not gonna talk to you. I am also really anxious about everything.

## I'm queer.
In 2 ways. [Both weird](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/queer#:~:text=strange%20or%20odd%20from%20a%20conventional%20viewpoint%3B%20unusually%20different%3B%20singular%3A) and [gay](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/queer#:~:text=Slang%3AOften,gender%20binary.).
As said on the home page, I'm trans. Meaning I disagree with the sex I was assigned at birth. Learn more by clicking [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender). **Before you click on it, please remember that gender does not equal sex. Gender is a social construct.**

## I'm really silly.
I make goofy funny things on the internet very frequently. I try to make jokes about almost everything I do.
